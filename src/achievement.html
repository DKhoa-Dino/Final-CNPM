	<h1 align="center" class="mt-4">3Rs – Reduce, Reuse & Recycle</h1>
	<h6 align="center" class="mt-2" style="opacity: 0.5;">The three R's – reduce, reuse and recycle – all help to cut down on the amount of waste we throw away. They conserve natural resources, landfill space and energy. Plus, the three R's save land and money communities must use to dispose of waste in landfills. Siting a new landfill has become difficult and more expensive due to environmental regulations and public opposition. </h6>

	<div class="col w-100">
		<h4>REDUCE:  The best way to manage waste is to not produce it. This can be done by shopping carefully and being aware of a few guidelines:</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Buy products in bulk. Larger, economy-size products or ones in concentrated form use less packaging and usually cost less per ounce.</li>
		<li>Avoid over-packaged goods, especially ones packed with several materials such as foil, paper, and plastic. They are difficult to recycle, plus you pay more for the package.</li>
		<li>Avoid disposable goods, such as paper plates, cups, napkins, razors, and lighters. Throwaways contribute to the problem, and cost more because they must be replaced again and again.</li>
		<li>Buy durable goods – ones that are well-built or that carry good warranties. They will last longer, save money in the long run and save landfill space.</li>
		<li>At work, make two-sided copies when ever possible.</li>
		<li>Maintain central files rather than using several files for individuals..</li>
		<li>Remove your name from the mailing lists of materials you no longer want to receive: write to Mail Preference Service, c/o Direct Marketing Assoc., P.O. Box 90008, Farmingdale, NY 11735</li>
		<li>Use cloth napkins instead of paper napkins.</li>
		<li>Use a dish cloth instead of paper towels.</li>
	<h4>REUSE:  It makes economic and environmental sense to reuse products. Sometimes it takes creativity:</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Reuse products for the same purpose. Save paper and plastic bags, and repair broken appliances, furniture and toys.</li>
		<li>Reuse products in different ways. Use a coffee can to pack a lunch; use plastic microwave dinner trays as picnic dishes.</li>
		<li>Sell old clothes, appliances, toys, and furniture in garage sales or ads, or donate them to charities.</li>
		<li>Use reseal able containers rather than plastic wrap.</li>
		<li>Use a ceramic coffee mug instead of paper cups.</li>
		<li>Reuse grocery bags or bring your own cloth bags to the store. Do not take a bag from the store unless you need one.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>RECYCLE:  Recycling is a series of steps that takes a used material and processes, remanufactures, and sells it as a new product. Begin recycling at home and at work:</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Buy products made from recycled material. Look for the recycling symbol or ask store managers or salesmen. The recycling symbol means one of two things – either the product is made of recycled material, or the item can be recycled. For instance, many plastic containers have a recycling symbol with a numbered code the identifies what type of plastic resin it is made from. However, just because the container has this code does not mean it can be easily recycled locally.</li>
		<li>Check collection centers and curbside pickup services to see what they accept, and begin collecting those materials. These can include metal cans, newspapers, paper products, glass, plastics and oil.</li>
		<li>Consider purchasing recycled materials at work when purchasing material for office supply, office equipment or manufacturing.</li>
		<li>Speak to store managers and ask for products and packaging that help cut down on waste, such as recycled products and products that are not over packaged.</li>
	</ul>

<h4>One man spent the last 40 years planting 1 tree every day… he is the Forest Man</h4>
<h4>India’s Forest Man started planting trees on the worlds largest river island in 1979. Today it’s even bigger than Central Park!</h4>
<p>In 1979 a man by the name of Jadav Payeng started planting trees in a wasteland. He went to this area every single day and planted a new tree. Now over 40 years later, he has planted something so spectacular they created a small documentary about him.
The forest he planted is now bigger than New York City’s Central Park. When Jadav started out, he planted a few seeds on a barren space and now the forest is over 500 hectares, 3 months out of the year it is home to elephants and now boasts a population of Indian rhino as well as tigers
</p>
<h2>Jadav Payeng: The Man Who Planted an Entire Forest by Himself</h2>
<p>Jadav Payeng, known as the Forest Man of India, spent 30 years of his life planting trees to save his island, creating a forest and restoring wildlife in it. 
Jadav Payeng is better known as the Forest Man of India. He earned this name by spending 30 years of his life planting trees, creating a real man-made forest of 550 hectares. Thanks to this reforestation, wildlife has returned to the area. Incredibly, he did it all by himself. This is his story.

<h2 align="left" >Molai Kathoni forest: A one-man-made forest </h2>
<p>The Mulai Reserve is a forest on the Majuli Island in the Brahmaputra River near Kokilamukh in the Jorhat district in Assam, India. It has a total area of about 1,000 hectares and is under continuous threat due to the extensive soil erosion on its banks.
Majuli has shrunk over the past 70 years by more than half. There are concerns that it could be submerged within the next 20 years. To fight this, in 1980, the Assam Forestry Division of Golaghat district began a plan to reforest 200 hectares of the forest in one of the sandbars of the Brahmaputra river.

<h3 align="left" >The history of formation and development of solar panels</h3>
<p>Quantitative solar cells were first created in 1883 by Charle Fritts with the initial efficiency of only 1%. But before that the discoverer of the photoelectric effect was the legal house of Alexandre Edmond Becquerel in 1839. He realized that solar energy can produce a photoelectric effect (photo = light, voltaic = voltage) . In the 1880s, a selenium (PV) photovoltaic cell was developed that could convert light into electricity with an efficiency of 1-2% of the efficiency of the solar cell as the proportion of available sunlight converted. by the photovoltaic cell, but the change is not proven. Therefore, photovoltaic energy has remained a curiosity for many years, as it is ineffective in converting light from the sun into electricity. It followed that until Albert Einstein proposed an explanation for the "photoelectric effect" in the early 1900s, after which he was awarded the Nobel Prize.
 Solar technology approached its current design in 1908 when William J. Bailey of Carnegie Company invented it with an insulating box and selenium rod. To verify that the human resource has put selenium inside a container with a slide. When the lid is closed and no light can enter, the selenium bar has the highest resistance… </p>
