				<h4>Plant tree</h4>
				<p>
				  Born during the time of President Ho Chi Minh, he attaches great
				  importance to the planting of trees for afforestation. Over the past
				  60 years, the Tree planting Festival initiated by him has become a
				  powerful, extensive and practical mass movement. Continuing that
				  spirit, for many years, the Party and State have always paid
				  attention to the planting of trees to cause forests in association
				  with environmental and resource protection. However, economic
				  activity and growth have put pressure on social life as population
				  growth and urbanization are taking place increasingly strongly and
				  broadly. Green belts that protect the environment are not interested
				  in protection planning, especially in young urban areas. In
				  addition, climate change has caused negative impacts on social life
				  by extreme weather phenomena: storms, floods, prolonged salinity,
				  landslides, sea erosion ...

				<h4>MEANING AND ORIGINAL SOURCE EVENTS</h4>
				<p>
					Launched in 2017 in Sydney (Australia), Earth Hour is the only, largest and most engaged event on Earth so far. Small actions such as turning off electrical appliances when not in use, saving water, planting a row of trees will bring great meaning to the community, forming an energy-saving habit, protecting the environment in all year.
					When was Earth Hour born?
					Starting in 2007 in Sydney (Australia), the number of participants was only 2 million people. Earth Hour is an annual international event, run by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), which urges households and businesses to turn off their lights and electrical appliances. Big people come to live for one hour at 20:30 to 21:30 p.m. (local time) on the last Saturday of March every year.

					Why remove plastic straws?
				  </h4>
				  <p>
					Restaurants, shops, supermarkets, .. paper straws are being greeted
				  with great enthusiasm. Instead of using plastic straws as before,
				  everyone has turned to paper straws. In 2020, Starbucks officially
				  removes plastic straws from its headquarters. Seattle - a beautiful
				  US city has also imposed a ban on plastic straws since July 2018. In
				  many other countries such as the UK and Ireland, they are also
				  testing and eliminating plastic straws. One study showed that, in
				  the United States, Americans emit 500 million plastic cigarettes
				  every day. All of them only used a straw once and thrown away. Most
				  of these straws are sent to the oceans, polluting beaches around the
				  world.

				<h4>The importance of paper bags to protect the environment</h4>
				<p>
				  In this modern life, especially in Vietnam, it can be said that
				  plastic bags are widely used, used in unlimited quantities, flooded
				  in markets, supermarkets or shops. Wherever there is trading
				  activity, plastic bags appear. Most plastic bags are used only a few
				  times and then dumped in landfills, streets, rivers or underground.
				  These plastic bags, even in the environment, can not decompose for
				  thousands of years, causing many dangerous consequences to the
				  health and environment of humans and organisms. Therefore, every
				  person, every business needs to be conscious of environmental
				  protection and use of environmentally friendly products. In
				  particular, the birth of environmentally friendly paper bags using
				  safe recycled materials is supported and trusted by many people.
